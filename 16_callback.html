        In JavaScript, a callback function is a function that is passed
        as an argument to another function and is executed after a
        particular operation has been completed. Callbacks are commonly
        used in asynchronous programming to handle events or responses from
        asynchronous operations like fetching data from a server, reading files,
        or handling user input.
        */

      function ask(question, onYes, onCancel) {
        console.log(question);
        const response = prompt(
          "Type 'yes' if you agree, or 'no' if you disagree."
        );

        if (response.toLowerCase() === "yes") {
          onYes();
        } else {
          onCancel();
        }
      }

      function showYes() {
        console.log("You agreed.");
      }

      function showCancel() {
        console.log("You canceled the execution.");
      }

      // usage: functions showOk, showCancel are passed as arguments to ask
      ask("Do you agree?", showYes, showCancel);

      //Function Expressions to write an equivalent, shorter function

      ask(
        "shorter function",
        function () {
          alert("function 1");
        },
        function () {
          alert("function2");
        }
      );
    </script>

    <!----
    NOTE
    In JavaScript, Function Declarations can be 
    called before they are defined. 
    This is because JavaScript processes global 
    Function Declarations before executing the script. 
    This initialization stage allows functions 
    to be visible and callable throughout the script, 
    regardless of 
    their position in the code. Thus, 
    JavaScript's internal algorithms ensure that functions declared globally are available for use throughout the script's execution.

    But if we use function expression the it will result in an error
